  containing the list of options
* Add other prints as per reqs
** List ongoing projects
* Flag option to print slow
* Flag option to print interactive entries (e.g. `y` to accept `n` to
  re-generate last offer)
* Flag option to suggest same (default) or various foods for lunch
  through supper
* Include configurable option to force a certain food type once per day (e.g.
  Huel)
* Add other (config per week day) listings as per reqs
** Grooming suggestions
** Entertainment suggesetions
** Memo listing
* Consider if more tuning is needed (e.g. day of month, etc.)
* Add a suggestion for "unusual experience" and day countdown till event
* Every x (e.g. 30+) days, e.g. doc review reminders
** First Saturday after x days have passed would be lovely
*** Can probably be implemented without the need to track days, e.g. print
    if % days < 7 && weekday == Saturday;
